/*
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it.

Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰
