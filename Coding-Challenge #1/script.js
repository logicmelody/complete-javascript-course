/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).

Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

function compareBMI(markInfo = {}, johnInfo = {}) {
	const markHigherBMI = getBMI(markInfo.mass, markInfo.height) > getBMI(johnInfo.mass, johnInfo.height);

	return markHigherBMI;
}

function getBMI(mass, height) {
	return mass / height ** 2;
}

console.log(compareBMI({ mass: 78, height: 1.69, }, { mass: 92, height: 1.95, }));
console.log(compareBMI({ mass: 95, height: 1.88, }, { mass: 85, height: 1.76, }));
